    "The slope is positive, so more sleep is linked to higher energy level, but the magnitude is small and not statistically significant. \n",

    "I think most of the reason this is not causal is due to the dataset. There are very few observations, also only taken at one point in time. There are also other factors like excercise, time of year, general stress. "
